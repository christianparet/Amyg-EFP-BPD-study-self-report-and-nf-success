## What this is about
This repository has code for analysis of neurofeedback data, that is, the Amyg-EFP signal and the feedback that the training was based on. The purpose of the code explained below is the analysis of learning success to modulate the Amyg-EFP across the training sessions.

## File structure
- This Readme file with an overview of project and content
- Code directory with code to aggregate sourcedata and for statistical data analysis
- Aggregated data directory with tables of subject data
- Figures directory of graphical outputs
- Sourcedata directory (unzip before use) with the EEG-neurofeedback logfiles containing Amyg-EFP value (arbitrary scale) and feedback volume intensity (0-1, 0=silent, 1=max. volume) of the training sessions

## EEG-neurofeedback training data
Analysis of within-neurofeedback session Amyg-EFP data.
- Data aggregation: Matlab-program EEG_training_data_aggregation.m retrieves Amyg-EFP and feedback volume information from logfiles and produces aggregated tables of oucome measures. The program calculates neurofeedback success measures such as personal effect size (Paret et al., 2019) and common language effect size (CLES, McGraw & Wong, 1992). Data tables (txt-files) produced with this program can be found in the aggregated data directory.
- Statistical analysis: R-program EFP_MLM_PES_publish.R estimates the multilevel model (MLM) and assesses significance. An MLM reflecting the nested data structure (sessions in participants) to assess significance of a linear Session effect (after mean-centering). That is, an incremental increase of Amyg-EFP activation across sessions is assumed. The MLM includes a Subject random effect, a linear Session random effect and a random Subject x Session interaction. 
- Graphical display: Figure_EEG_training_data.R produces plots showing mean-subject-timecourses of Amyg-EFP values and feedback values, averaged across session.
