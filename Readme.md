# Project description
The modulation of brain circuits of emotion is a promising pathway to the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Precise and scalable approaches have yet to be established. 
The research presented in this repository is from a study investigating neurofeedback (NF) as a means to improve brain self-regulation in BPD.
A 10-session Amyg-EFP NF training in parallel to a 12-weeks residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) program. 
N=15 patients with BPD completed the training, N=14 matched patients served as DBT-only controls.

# Purpose and highlights of the project
Results showed significant learning of Amyg-EFP modulation with NF training. No clinical benefits of NF beyond DBT-only were observed. Measured with scalp EEG, the Amyg-EFP picks up brain activation of high relevance for emotion. Feasibility of Amyg-EFP NF as add-on to BPD treatment was shown. Clinical utility remains to be investigated. The project involved a second study, where simultaneous fMRI-EEG was acquired in N=16 subjects with BPD. Mapping of Amyg-EFP to whole-brain fMRI-BOLD signal was investigated. More information of this study can be found in the original article. Results from this study are available on neurovault (https://neurovault.org/collections/JBICXOQC/). Single-subject data can be requested from the author.
